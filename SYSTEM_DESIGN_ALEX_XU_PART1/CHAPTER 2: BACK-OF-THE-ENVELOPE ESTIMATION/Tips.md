#### Tips:

Back of the envelope estimation is all about the process. Solving the problems is more important than obtaining the results. 

* **Rounding and Approximation:** 
* **Write down your assumptions:** to be referenced later
* **Label your units:** writing down simply as "5", does it mean 5 MB or 5 GB? Writing down 5 MB solves the ambiguity 
* **Commonly asked back-of-the-envelope estimations:** QPS, peak QPS, storage, cache, number of servers etc., Practice these calculations when preparing for interview. Practice makes perfect.
