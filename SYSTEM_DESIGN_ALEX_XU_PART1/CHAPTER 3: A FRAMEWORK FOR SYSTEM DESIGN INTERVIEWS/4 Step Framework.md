###### Four Step Framework:

#### Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope.**

#### Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in.**
  1. Initial blueprint for the design
  2. Box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper. 
     Clients (Web/Mobile), APIs, web servers, data stores, Cache, CDN, message queue etc.,
  3. Do back-of-the-envelope calculations to evaluate if your blueprint fits the scale constraints. 
     Think out loud. Communicate with the interviewer if back-of-the envelope is necessary before diving into it.

  * Go through a few **concrete use cases** This will help you frame the **high-level design.** It is also likely that use cases would help you discover the **edge cases** you have not yet considered.
  

  **Eg: Design a news feed system**

  **Feed publishing:**  when user publishes a post, correspomding data is written into cache/database, and the post appears later in the friend's news feed.

  **News Feed Building:**  the news feed is built by posts aggregating in reverse chronological order.
