#### Wrap up

Interviewer might ask few follow up questions or give you freedom to discuss other additional points

Below are the directions to follow:

* **Bottle necks and Potential improvements:** great opportunity to showcase your critical thinking and leave a final good impression.
* **Recap of the design**: helpful when you provide few solutions. refreshing interview's memory can be helpful after a long session.
* **Error cases :** server failure, network loss etc., interesting thnings to talk about
* **Operation issues:** How do you monitor metrics and error logs? How to roll out the system?
* **Handling next scale curve:**  if current design supports 1 million useers, what are the changes to be done to support 10 million users?
* Propoese any othe requirements when you have time.

**Do's**                                                              
* Always ask for clarifications. Do not assume your assumption is correct.      
*  Understand the requirements of the problem.
*  There is neither right answer nor the best answer. 
*  Let the interview know that what you are thinking. Communicate with your interview.
*  Suggest multiple approaches if possible.
*  Once you agree with your interviewer on the blueprint, go into details on each component. Design the most critical component first
*  Bounce ideas off the interviewer. A good interviewer works with you as a teammate.
*  Never give up.
  
**Don'ts**
* Dont be unprepared for the typical interview questions.
* Dont jump into the solutions without clarifying the requirements and assumptions.
* Dont get into too much detail on a single component in the begining. Give the high level design first then drills down.
* If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for hints.
* Dont think your interview is donce once you give the design. You are not done until your interviewer says you are done. Ask for feedback early and often.


**Time allocation for each step**

* System Design interviews are very broad it can be 45 minutes or an hour is not enough to cover entire design.
* Time management is essential.
  
  Below is the probable distribution of time of 45 minutes

  Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish a design scope. **3-10 minutes**
  Step 2 - Propose high level design and get buy-in: **10-15 minutes**
  Step 3 - Design deep dive. **10-25 minutes**
  Step 4 - Wrap. **3-5 minutes**
